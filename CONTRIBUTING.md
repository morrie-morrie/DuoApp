This is my first time using a public Repository on Github. Please be kind :)

I'll update this once I understand more about it.
Currently I'm happy for people to review my code and provide recommendations on how I might improve.
Please don't reformat the code as it will just make a mess of the Pull request and make it hugely difficult to see what you real changes are.
